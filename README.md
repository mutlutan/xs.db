The purpose of this component is;

With this component, which I made in 2013-2014, it is used to connect query and db controls by drag and drop, similar to the use in Delphide database components, and it supports multiple database types. The Custom db type has been designed so that it can be added (as a plugin) without recompiling the project.

Fast practical application development is possible by using the drag and drop logic in Delphi in win form projects. While it was active in versions before Visual Studio 2015, I did not update the later versions (I did not need to compile to new versions from working actively in the web environment and with the entity framework output).
